  <h1>👋 About Me</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🤖 AI vs Machine Learning – What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the big idea — teaching machines to mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is one way to achieve AI. It’s about training computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      All machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.
    </div>

    <h2>💻 My Background in Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>I’ve spent years working in software engineering — writing, testing, and improving software systems. As technology evolved, so did the tools we use. AI is now being used to detect and classify software bugs and vulnerabilities, helping us catch problems faster and earlier in the development process.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked on projects that use AI to read code, analyze error reports, and even predict where bugs are most likely to occur.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔐 Cybersecurity Knowledge</h2>
    <p>My work in cybersecurity has helped me understand how software systems can be attacked — and how we can protect them. I focus on building secure systems, analyzing threats, and teaching others how to write safer code. AI plays a growing role in this space too — helping us detect intrusions, malware, and risky behaviors.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💬 Questions for You</h2>
    <div class="question">
      ❓ Do you use AI tools? (Like ChatGPT, DALL·E, or Google Lens?) What do you use them for?
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      🔮 Where do you think AI is headed in the next 5 years? What would you like to see it do?
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      ⚠️ When should we <strong>not</strong> use AI? Can you think of moments where a human touch is better than automation?
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎯 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>AI is a powerful tool, but it’s not magic. Understanding when and how to use it — especially in areas like software and security — helps us build better, safer, and smarter systems. And learning this early means you can help shape the future, not just watch it happen.</p>
