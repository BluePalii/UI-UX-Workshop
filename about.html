  <h1>👨‍🏫 About Me</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📛 Who Am I?</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mohammad Jamil Ahmad (MJ Ahmad)</p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Assistant Professor of Management Information Systems and Cybersecurity</p>
    <p>I teach university courses that help students understand the digital world around them — including coding using <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> to solve business problems, as well as cybersecurity topics like auditing, secure systems, and software reliability.</p>
    <p>My research explores how <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> can help us improve software security — like detecting bugs and vulnerabilities before they become serious issues. I also use <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> to analyze software behavior, extract insights from financial documents, and understand how language affects system security.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🤖 AI vs Machine Learning – What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the big idea — teaching machines to mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is one way to achieve AI. It’s about training computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      All machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💻 My Background in Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>I’ve spent years working in software engineering — writing, testing, and improving software systems. As technology evolved, so did the tools we use. AI is now being used to detect and classify software bugs and vulnerabilities, helping us catch problems faster and earlier in the development process.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked on projects that use AI to read code, analyze error reports, and even predict where bugs are most likely to occur.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔐 Cybersecurity Knowledge</h2>
    <p>My work in cybersecurity has helped me understand how software systems can be attacked — and how we can protect them. I focus on building secure systems, analyzing threats, and teaching others how to write safer code. AI plays a growing role in this space too — helping us detect intrusions, malware, and risky behaviors.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📄 A Real Problem I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>Right now, I’m working with nearly <strong>2 million 8-K filings</strong> — public documents submitted to the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong> by companies to announce major events. These can include acquisitions, leadership changes, and stock offerings.</p>
    <p><strong>What is an 8-K?</strong> It’s a report that provides shareholders and the public with timely information about a company. Think of it like a public diary of big events for companies that are traded on the stock market.</p>
    <p>In particular, I'm trying to extract 3 important pieces of information from these documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📆 <strong>The date</strong> the stock was sold (this is usually structured and appears at the top)</li>
      <li>💵 <strong>The price per share</strong></li>
      <li>📊 <strong>The number of shares sold</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The challenge? The date is easy — but the language describing the sale is not structured and can appear in dozens of different ways. Here are just a few examples from real filings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“We issued 500,000 shares of common stock at $4.25 per share.”</li>
      <li>“Each share was sold for a purchase price of $6.15.”</li>
      <li>“Gross proceeds of $3.2 million from the sale of 400,000 shares.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How can we train a machine to understand and extract that information? Could you design a system that understands this flexible language? What kind of <strong>AI tools</strong> might help — like language models, pattern matching, or machine learning classifiers?</p>
    <div class="callout">
      💡 <strong>Bonus Challenge:</strong><br>
      If you were building an AI to do this task, what data would you train it on? How would you test its accuracy? What would you do if the AI missed something important?
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💬 Questions for You</h2>
    <div class="question">
      ❓ Do you use AI tools? (Like ChatGPT, DALL·E, or Google Lens?) What do you use them for?
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      🔮 Where do you think AI is headed in the next 5 years? What would you like to see it do?
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      ⚠️ When should we <strong>not</strong> use AI? Can you think of moments where a human touch is better than automation?
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎯 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>AI is a powerful tool, but it’s not magic. Understanding when and how to use it — especially in areas like software and security — helps us build better, safer, and smarter systems. And learning this early means you can help shape the future, not just watch it happen.</p>
