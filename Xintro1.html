    <h1>What Are UI and UX?</h1>

    <h2>üñåÔ∏è UI: User Interface</h2>
    <p>This is how something <strong>looks</strong>. It includes colors, buttons, spacing, images, and overall design. If your app or website were a car, the UI would be the paint, the dashboard, the buttons, and the seats.</p>

    <h2>üß† UX: User Experience</h2>
    <p>This is how something <strong>feels</strong>. Is it easy to use? Can you find what you're looking for? Is it frustrating or fun? UX is all about the user's journey.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>88%</strong> of users won‚Äôt return after a bad experience <span class="source">(Source: Amazon Web Services)</span></li>
      <li><strong>First impressions</strong> are 94% related to UI design <span class="source">(Source: Northumbria University)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Every $1</strong> spent on UX brings $100 in return <span class="source">(Source: Forrester)</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real Examples</h2>
    <p><strong>Good UI & UX:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple.com</a> ‚Äì clean, easy to navigate, consistent feel and visuals.</p>
    <p><strong>Good UI, Bad UX:</strong> A beautiful website that takes forever to load or has confusing navigation.</p>
    <p><strong>Bad UI, Good UX:</strong> Craigslist ‚Äì it's ugly, but it gets the job done fast.</p>
    <p><strong>Bad UI & UX:</strong> Pop-up-ridden scammy sites ‚Äî confusing, slow, and stressful.</p>

    <blockquote>‚ÄúPeople ignore design that ignores people.‚Äù ‚Äì Frank Chimero</blockquote>

    <p>When you design anything ‚Äî an app, a poster, even a sign ‚Äî you‚Äôre making choices that affect how people understand and enjoy it. UI and UX are your tools for making great choices.</p>
